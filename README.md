# HonoursProjectCode

This is a repository to back up and version control all of the code for my honours project.
This is a collection of  R-studio notebooks. The notebooks correspond to each project in the repository.
The R scripts should be used to run experiments and can be reused for different datasets (as long as label is in the last column).
